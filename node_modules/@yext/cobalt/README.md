# Cobalt - Sub Generator for Yext Pages

Cobalt is a collection of installable features for Yext Pages, contributed by the Professional Services team at Yext.

## Installation

Cobalt is already installed in Yext Pages sites using the *site-starter-react-consulting* starter

```
npm install --save-dev @yext/cobalt plop
```

2) Add `plopfile.js` to your project's root

```
export default async (plop) => {
  await plop.load("@yext/cobalt");
};
```

3) Add generate script to `package.json`

```
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "generate": "plop"
  }
}
```

## Usage

1) Run plop

```
npm run generate
```

2) Choose the 'Cobalt' generator from the list (if you only have one generator installed it will run it automatically)
